## Current Features
* YouTube icon button in toolbar that allows you to pause/play your currently running video from 
  any window/tab

  * _Note: If there are multiple YouTube videos open, the button will only work for the most_
    _recently opened video. Once the most recent video is closed, the button will then work_
    _on the second most recently opened video, and so on and so forth_

* A set of labeled buttons placed beneath the YouTube video for easier adjustment of playback 
  speed along with more speed options than currently offered by YouTube
  * Speeds currently go from 1x - 6x (if you want slower speeds, feel free to fork/clone this repo
    and implement it yourself. I like the fast speeds for watching lecture videos)

  * _Note: The number of speed options available depends on what view the video player is in,_
    _as well as the current "zoom" of the page. For example "Theater Mode" has more options_
    _than "Default View", but zooming out in "Default View" will then reveal more speed options_

_Final Note: This extension currently only works with **YouTube videos** on the **YouTube website**._
_That means it won't work on embedded YouTube videos or videos from other streaming sites such as_
_Vimeo. However, this extension should be pretty easy to expand to other sites so long as they use HTML5_
_for videos. And since [Flash is dying](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/aug/24/adobe-flash-dying-amazon-google-chrome)_
_it won't be long before everyone uses HTML5 for video content!_
